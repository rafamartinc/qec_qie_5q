#### Authors: J. Lacalle, L. M. Pozo-Coronado, A. L. Fonseca de Oliveira, R. Martin-Cuevas

This notebook complements the homonymous article written by the authors, by proving several claims made in the article with the assistance of a symbolic calculus library for Python, as well as in wxMaxima.

## 1. Python Implementation

### 1.1. Online visualization (without installation)

You may have a look at the latest version of the Jupyter notebook in the following link:
